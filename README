Teensy code for The Button.

What is "The Button" exactly? See here:

  http://rasterweb.net/raster/2011/05/09/the-button/

You'll need to install the Arduino IDE and the Teensduino add-on.

The code allows the Teensy to emulate a space bar when the button 
is pressed, and you can't do it faster than once per half second.

In the code, pin 10 is for the button and pin 11 is for the LED.

The on-board LED turns on when you push the button. It's for debugging 
more than anything else, but you could wire up an external LED to light 
up if you were so inclined.
